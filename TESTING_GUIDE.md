# RostraCore Testing Guide

Complete step-by-step guide to test all features of the RostraCore application.

---

## Prerequisites Check

Before starting, ensure you have:
- ‚úÖ Python 3.9+ installed
- ‚úÖ Node.js 18+ installed
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL installed (or Docker for containerized PostgreSQL)
- ‚úÖ Git installed

---

## Step 1: Start PostgreSQL Database

### Option A: Using Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd C:\Users\CPS\Documents\dotroster\backend

# Start PostgreSQL container
docker-compose up -d

# Verify it's running
docker-compose ps
```

**Expected output**: You should see `rostracore_db` container running on port 5432

### Option B: Using Local PostgreSQL

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL service
# Windows: Start from Services or run:
net start postgresql-x64-14

# Verify connection
psql -U rostracore_user -d rostracore
# Enter password: your_secure_password
# Type \q to exit
```

---

## Step 2: Set Up Backend

### 2.1 Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
cd C:\Users\CPS\Documents\dotroster\backend

# Activate virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate

# You should see (venv) in your terminal prompt
```

### 2.2 Install Python Dependencies (if not already done)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2.3 Run Database Migrations

```bash
# Apply all migrations to create database tables
alembic upgrade head
```

**Expected output**:
```
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade -> xxxxx, Initial schema
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade xxxxx -> yyyyy, ...
```

### 2.4 Start Backend Server

```bash
# Start FastAPI server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

**Expected output**:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [xxxx] using WatchFiles
INFO:     Started server process [yyyy]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

**‚úÖ Backend is now running at: http://localhost:8000**

### 2.5 Test Backend API (in a new terminal)

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Or open in browser:
# http://localhost:8000/docs (Swagger UI)
```

---

## Step 3: Start Frontend

### 3.1 Open New Terminal

3. Restart backend server
4. Retry the operation
   - **‚úÖ Expected**: Works correctly

---

## Step 6: Verify Data Persistence

1. Create some employees, sites, and shifts
2. Stop both frontend and backend servers
3. Restart both servers
4. Check that all data is still present

**‚úÖ Expected Result**: All data persists (stored in PostgreSQL)

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Connection Refused" when accessing backend

**Solution**:
- Ensure backend server is running on port 8000
- Check: `http://localhost:8000/health`
- Verify no other process is using port 8000

### Issue: Frontend shows "Failed to fetch"

**Solution**:
- Check backend is running
- Verify CORS is enabled in backend
- Check `.env.local` has correct API URL

### Issue: Database connection errors

**Solution**:
- Verify PostgreSQL is running
- Check credentials in `backend/.env`
- Run: `psql -U rostracore_user -d rostracore` to test connection

### Issue: "Module not found" errors

**Solution**:
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
```
