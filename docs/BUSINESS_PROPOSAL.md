## Problem Statement

Security companies like yours face a complex operational challenge: **managing workforce scheduling across multiple sites while controlling costs, ensuring compliance, and maintaining service quality.** Current manual or spreadsheet-based methods are:

- **Time-intensive:** 8-12 hours per week spent on roster creation
- **Error-prone:** Leading to scheduling conflicts, gaps in coverage, and compliance violations
- **Costly:** Resulting in unoptimized assignments, excessive overtime, and budget overruns
- **Reactive:** Unable to predict staffing issues before they occur

### The Cost of Manual Rostering

For a security company managing **50-100 guards** across **5-10 sites**:

| Issue | Annual Cost Impact |
|-------|-------------------|
| Administrative Time (40 hrs/month @ R350/hr) | R 168,000 |
| Scheduling Errors & Conflicts | R 85,000 - R 150,000 |
| Unoptimized Overtime (15% excess) | R 120,000 - R 200,000 |
| Compliance Fines & Penalties | R 50,000 - R 100,000 |
| Poor Resource Utilization | R 80,000 - R 120,000 |
| **Total Annual Impact** | **R 503,000 - R 738,000** |
