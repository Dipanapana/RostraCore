## Sample Data to Show

### Good Demo Data Set:
- **10-15 employees** (mix of armed, unarmed, supervisors)
- **3-5 sites** (different locations and requirements)
- **20-30 shifts** (various dates, some assigned, some unassigned)
- **5-10 availability records**
- **3-5 certifications** (at least 1-2 expiring soon)

### How to Create Sample Data:
Use the API docs at http://localhost:8000/docs:

1. POST /api/v1/employees - Create employees
2. POST /api/v1/sites - Create sites
3. POST /api/v1/shifts - Create shifts
4. POST /api/v1/certifications - Add certifications
5. POST /api/v1/roster/generate - Generate roster

Or use the frontend forms (slower but more visual).

## Questions You'll Get (Be Prepared!)

### Q: "How fast is the roster generation?"
**A:** "50 employees √ó 300 shifts = 2-5 seconds. Scales to 200+ employees."

### Q: "What if we already have a system?"
**A:** "Full REST API allows integration. We can import/export data via CSV or API."

### Q: "How do you handle last-minute changes?"
**A:** "Re-run the algorithm instantly. Takes seconds to regenerate optimized roster."

### Q: "What about overtime calculations?"
**A:** "Built-in. Algorithm tracks hours per employee and applies OT multiplier (1.5x default)."

### Q: "Is it secure?"
**A:** "Authentication coming next. Currently, all data stays on your servers. No cloud dependency required."

### Q: "How much does it cost?"
**A:** "See the Business Proposal (docs/BUSINESS_PROPOSAL.md):
- Implementation: R45-65k (one-time)
- Subscription: R8.5-12k/month (50-100 guards)
- ROI: 2-3 months payback"

### Q: "Can we customize reports?"
**A:** "Yes. Dashboard API provides all data. Custom reports via PDF generation (coming next)."

## Demo Tips

### DO:
‚úÖ Have sample data loaded beforehand
‚úÖ Show the dashboard first (most impressive)
‚úÖ Emphasize cost savings and compliance
‚úÖ Point out real-time nature of metrics
‚úÖ Highlight the professional UI
‚úÖ Mention no AI = predictable and explainable
‚úÖ Show the algorithm actually working (roster generation)

### DON'T:
‚ùå Get bogged down in technical details initially
‚ùå Show empty dashboards (no data)
‚ùå Apologize for "incomplete features"
‚ùå Click through every menu item
‚ùå Spend too long on any one page
‚ùå Forget to emphasize ROI and business value

---

## Value Proposition (30-second version)

"Security companies waste 8-12 hours per week creating rosters manually, leading to scheduling errors, compliance violations, and cost overruns. RostraCore automates this with proven optimization algorithms, reducing roster time by 95% while cutting labor costs by 15-25%. Our dashboard gives you real-time visibility into costs, compliance, and operations. Clients typically see ROI within 3 months."
