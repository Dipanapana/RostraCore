# Emotional Journey Map - RostraCore

**Author:** Dr. Amara Okonkwo (Psychological Design Consultant)
**Date:** 2025-11-09
**Purpose:** Map user emotional states and design appropriate responses

---

## Overview

Security company owners using RostraCore move through predictable emotional states. Our design must acknowledge and support each emotional transition.

**Core Principle:** *Users don't remember features. They remember how you made them feel.*

## The 5 Emotional States

### 1. 😰 FEAR (Pre-signup)
**Emotion:** Anxiety, skepticism, overwhelm
**User Thoughts:**
- "Another platform that won't work for my specific needs"
- "What if I lose data?"
- "Can I trust this company with my payroll?"
- "Will my team actually use this?"

**Design Response:**
- ✅ Social proof from similar companies (name + guard count)
- ✅ PSIRA compliance badges prominently displayed
- ✅ "Data stays in South Africa" trust signal
- ✅ Risk reversal: "14-day trial, no credit card"
- ✅ Loss aversion messaging: "Stop losing R50K/year"

**Micro-copy Examples:**
```
❌ BAD: "Sign up now"
✅ GOOD: "Start Free Trial - No Credit Card Required"

❌ BAD: "Enter your details"
✅ GOOD: "We'll never share your information. POPIA compliant."

❌ BAD: "Submit"
✅ GOOD: "Continue (You can cancel anytime)"
```

### 2. 🌟 HOPE (First login / Onboarding start)
**Emotion:** Cautious optimism, curiosity
**User Thoughts:**

### 5. 🤝 TRUST (Ongoing usage / Power user)

## Critical Touchpoints

### 🎯 Moment 1: First Roster Generated (2 minutes)
**Emotion Transition:** Anxiety → Confidence

**Design:**
- Show countdown: "Generating... 23 seconds"
- Confetti animation on completion
- Side-by-side comparison: "Manual (4 hours) vs RostraCore (2 min)"
- Clear CTA: "Review & Publish"

**Micro-copy:**
```
"🎉 Your first roster is ready!

RostraCore just:
✓ Matched guards to sites by skills
✓ Ensured PSIRA compliance
✓ Optimized for zero overtime
✓ Saved you 3 hours and 54 minutes

Ready to review?"
```

---

### 🎯 Moment 2: First Error Encountered (Variable)
**Emotion Transition:** Hope → Anxiety (prevent regression)

**Design:**
- No red "ERROR" text
- Conversational, helpful tone
- Suggest solution immediately
- Option to contact support (1-click)

**Micro-copy:**
```
❌ BAD:
"Error 403: Forbidden. Access denied."

✅ GOOD:
"Hmm, looks like this guard isn't PSIRA-verified yet.

Want to:
→ Add their PSIRA number now (30 seconds)
→ Use a different guard for this shift
→ Contact support for help"
```

---

### 🎯 Moment 3: Subscription Payment (Day 14)
**Emotion Transition:** Trust → Fear (payment anxiety)

**Design:**
- Clear value recap: "You've saved 20 hours in 14 days"
- Flexible downgrade options visible
- Money-back guarantee prominent
- Payment security badges

**Micro-copy:**
```
"Your 14-day trial ends tomorrow

In the past 2 weeks, you:
✓ Generated 6 rosters (saved 24 hours)
✓ Hired 3 guards in 48 hours
✓ Avoided R4,500 in overtime

Continue with Professional plan?
R999/month · Cancel anytime · 30-day money-back guarantee"
```

---

## Micro-copy Principles

### ✅ DO:
1. **Use second person ("you/your")** - Creates intimacy
2. **Quantify everything** - "Save 20 hours" not "Save time"
3. **Use active voice** - "You saved R5,000" not "R5,000 was saved"
4. **Show progress** - "2 of 5 complete" not "3 remaining"
5. **Acknowledge emotions** - "We know rostering is stressful"
6. **Use SA terminology** - "Guards" not "Security Officers"
7. **Include time estimates** - "This takes 2 minutes"

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Don't use jargon** - "PSIRA reg. number" not "Regulatory compliance identifier"
2. **Don't blame users** - "Let's try again" not "You entered the wrong format"
3. **Don't hide costs** - Always show "(excl. VAT)"
4. **Don't overwhelm** - Show 3 options max, not 10
5. **Don't ignore context** - New users see different messages than power users

## Celebration Moments (Dopamine Triggers)

| Trigger Event | Celebration | Psychology |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| Account created | Confetti + "Welcome!" | Commitment |
| First employee added | "Great start! 💪" | Progress |
| First roster generated | Large confetti + savings shown | Achievement |
| First shift completed | "Your first shift went live! 🎯" | Validation |
| 10 rosters generated | Badge: "Rostering Pro" | Status |
| First guard hired | "You just saved 3 weeks! 🚀" | Impact |
| 30 days active | "1 month anniversary! 🎉" | Milestone |
| Referral made | "Thanks for spreading the word! 🙌" | Reciprocity |

---

## Error Handling Philosophy

**Principle:** Errors are learning opportunities, not failures.

### Error Message Template:
```
[Friendly acknowledgment] + [What happened] + [Why it matters] + [How to fix]

Example:
"Oops! That ID number is only 12 digits.

South African IDs are always 13 digits, which helps us verify PSIRA compliance.

Can you double-check and try again?"
```

### Error Severity Levels:

**🟢 Informational (Green)**
- "Just so you know: This guard hasn't logged in yet"
- Action: None required
- Tone: Helpful, friendly

**🟡 Warning (Yellow)**
- "Heads up: This roster has 2 uncovered shifts"
- Action: Suggested but optional
- Tone: Concerned, supportive

**🔴 Critical (Red - use sparingly)**
- "Payment failed: Please update your card details"
- Action: Required immediately
- Tone: Urgent but not alarming

## Cultural Considerations (South Africa)

- **English speakers:** More receptive to friendly, casual tone
- **Solution:** A/B test tone based on language selection

### Trust Building:
- Emphasize local data storage
- Show South African team photos
- Use ZAR currency exclusively
- Reference local regulations (BCEA, PSIRA)

### Social Proof:
- Use real South African company names (with permission)
- Show city locations (Johannesburg, Cape Town, Pretoria)
- Use realistic guard counts (20-200 range)

## Next Steps

1. **Audit existing copy** - Find every piece of text in the app
2. **Map to emotional states** - Which state is the user in when they see this?
3. **Rewrite for empathy** - Apply principles from this document
4. **Build components** - Create reusable UI for celebration, help, errors
5. **Test and iterate** - A/B test, measure, improve

---

**Remember:** Users will forget what you said, they'll forget what you did, but they'll never forget how you made them feel.
